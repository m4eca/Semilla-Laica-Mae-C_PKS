## Defensive vs. Offensive Security

- **Defensive Security (Blue Team):**
  - Focuses on **protecting networks and systems** from attacks.
  - Detects, monitors, and responds to threats before attackers exploit them.
  - Example: Monitoring suspicious activity in real time.

- **Offensive Security (Red Team):**
  - Aims to **find and exploit vulnerabilities** in systems.
  - Tests an organizationâ€™s defenses by simulating real-world attacks.
  - Helps identify weaknesses before malicious hackers can.

## Directory Discovery Tool

- **Gobuster:**
  - A tool used to **discover hidden directories and files** on a website.
  - Often used during web application penetration testing.
  
  **Example Command:**
  ```bash
  gobuster dir -u http://example.thm -w wordlist.txt

**Security Operations Center (SOC)**
- A SOC is responsible for monitoring and managing security within an organization.
- It continuously tracks system activity to detect, analyze, and respond to incidents.

**Key Tasks:**
- Detect unauthorized access or policy violations
- Investigate network intrusions
- Patch and reduce vulnerabilities across systems
- Threat Intelligence:
- The process of collecting and analyzing data about potential cyber threats.
- Helps security teams predict and prevent future attacks.

**Important Terms:**
- Threat: Something that could harm a system or network.
- Intelligence: Data and insights gathered from logs, security feeds, and public sources to understand threat behavior

## **Reflection


What I learned from this topic is how both sides of cybersecurity work together. The Red Team tries to attack, while the Blue Team defends and both are important in keeping systems secure. I also learned how tools like Gobuster help find hidden parts of a website that could be risky if not secured. This lesson gave me a better idea of how security operations actually run inside companies and how important it is to always test, monitor, and improve systems to stay safe from attacks.
