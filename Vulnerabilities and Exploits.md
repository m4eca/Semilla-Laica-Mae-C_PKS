## Definition 

Vulnerabilities are weaknesses or flaws in software, hardware, or configurations that can be leveraged by attackers. Exploits are the actual techniques or code used to take advantage of these vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access, disrupt operations, or steal data.

---

## **Types of Vulnerabilities**  
- **Input Validation Errors**: Failure to properly check user input (e.g., SQL injection, buffer overflow)  
- **Authentication Flaws**: Weak or broken login mechanisms  
- **Access Control Issues**: Improper enforcement of user roles or permissions  
- **Misconfigurations**: Default credentials, exposed services, or insecure settings  
- **Outdated Software**: Unpatched systems with known vulnerabilities  
- **Information Disclosure**: Leaking sensitive data through error messages or logs

---

## **Common Exploit Techniques**  
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: Running arbitrary code on a target system  
- **Privilege Escalation**: Gaining higher-level access than intended  
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Overloading a system to make it unavailable  
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)**: Intercepting and altering communications  
- **Social Engineering**: Manipulating users to gain access or information

---

## **Lifecycle of an Exploit**  
1. **Discovery**: Identifying a vulnerability  
2. **Development**: Crafting an exploit to target it  
3. **Delivery**: Deploying the exploit (e.g., via phishing, malicious input)  
4. **Execution**: Triggering the exploit to achieve the attacker's goal  
5. **Persistence**: Maintaining access or control over the system

--- 

## **Mitigation Strategies**  
- **Regular patching and updates**  
- **Secure coding practices**  
- **Access control and least privilege enforcement**  
- **Network segmentation and monitoring**  
- **Security testing and vulnerability scanning**  
- **User training and awareness**

## Reflection

I learned that vulnerabilities are weak spots in a system, and exploits are ways attackers use those weak spots to break in or cause damage. Some problems come from bad settings, old software, or not checking user input properly. It also helped me understand that attackers follow steps, like finding the weakness, building the exploit, and using it to get access. Knowing these steps makes it easier to spot issues early and protect the system better.
