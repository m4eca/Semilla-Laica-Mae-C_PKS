## Definition 
**Malware**, short for *malicious software*, refers to any program or code created to harm, exploit, or perform unwanted actions on a computer system.  

It’s one of the main threats in cybersecurity, often used by attackers to steal data, damage files, or gain unauthorized access.

**Malicious analysis** is the process of **studying malware behavior** to understand how it works, how it spreads, and how to stop it.  

It helps security professionals develop better defenses and detection strategies.

## Common Types of Malware

### 1. Virus
- Attaches itself to legitimate programs or files.  
- Spreads when the infected file is shared or executed.  
- Can delete, corrupt, or modify data.

### 2. Worm
- A self-replicating program that spreads across networks automatically.  
- Doesn’t need user interaction to infect other systems.  
- Commonly causes network congestion or crashes.

### 3. Trojan Horse
- Disguised as a legitimate file or software.  
- Once executed, it gives attackers remote access or control.  
- Often used to steal information or install other malware.

### 4. Ransomware
- Encrypts user files or locks the system until a ransom is paid.  
- Spreads through phishing emails, malicious downloads, or exploits.  
- One of the most damaging types of malware today.

### 5. Spyware
- Secretly monitors user activities (like keystrokes or browsing habits).  
- Collects personal data without permission.

### 6. Adware
- Displays unwanted ads or pop-ups.  
- Sometimes collects user data to show targeted ads.

### 7. Rootkit
- Hides itself deep inside the system to avoid detection.  
- Gives attackers privileged access to the operating system.

##  Malware Analysis Techniques

### **1. Static Analysis**
- Examines malware **without running it**.  
- Involves inspecting the code, file headers, or strings.  
- Useful for identifying known patterns and signatures.

### **2. Dynamic Analysis**
- Observes the malware **while it’s running** in a safe environment (sandbox).  
- Helps understand its real behavior — what files it changes, what servers it contacts, etc.

### **3. Behavioral Analysis**
- Focuses on how malware interacts with the system and network.  
- Helps detect new or unknown malware types based on suspicious activity.

## Tools for Malware Analysis

- **Wireshark** – monitors network traffic.  
- **Procmon (Process Monitor)** – tracks real-time system activity.  
- **IDA Pro / Ghidra** – disassembles and examines malware code.  
- **Cuckoo Sandbox** – runs malware safely for dynamic analysis.  
- **VirusTotal** – scans files with multiple antivirus engines.

## Best Practices for Protection

- Keep your **OS and applications updated**.  
- Use a **reliable antivirus or endpoint protection**.  
- Avoid downloading software from **untrusted sources**.  
- Be careful with **email attachments** and **links**.  
- Regularly **back up your data** to recover from ransomware attacks.

## Reflection

This topic helped me see how malware works in different ways. Some types spread fast, some hide deep, and some trick users into clicking or downloading. I also learned that analyzing malware is not just about stopping it, it’s about knowing how it behaves so we can prepare better. It reminded me to be careful with downloads, links, and keeping my system updated.
