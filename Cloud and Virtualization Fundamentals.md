### **Hypervisors (2 Types)**

- **Type 1 | Bare-Metal / Native**  
  → Runs directly on the **computer’s hardware**, no need for an OS first.  
  It’s like the **main boss** that controls all the virtual machines under it.  

- **Type 2 | Hosted**  
  → Works as a **program inside an existing operating system**.  
  It depends on the host OS to handle the hardware.  
  Easier to set up, but not as strong as Type 1.

### **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**

- A **CDN** is a group of **servers located in different parts of the world**.  
- It helps websites **load faster** by sending content from the **closest server** to the user.  
- It’s like **downloading from a nearby shop instead of one far away** — faster and smoother!

### ☁️ **Cloud Deployment Models**

| **Model** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Public Cloud** | The most common and affordable. Resources are available to everyone through the internet (ex: **Google Drive, AWS**). |
| **Private Cloud** | Used by **only one organization**. They control everything including setup, maintenance, and security. |
| **Hybrid Cloud** | A **combination of public and private clouds**. Some data stays internal, others are handled by public services. Security should be strong on both sides. |
| **Community Cloud** | Shared by **organizations with the same goals or requirements**. But connecting networks also means sharing possible risks. |
| **Single Tenancy** | **One user per system.** Each has their own environment and resources. |
| **Multi-Tenancy** | **Many users share the same system**, but everyone’s data is kept **separate and secure.** |

### **Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)**

- A **CASB** acts like a **security guard** between your device and cloud services.  
- It checks if you’re connecting safely and using the right security rules.  
- It gives visibility into how people use cloud apps and services.  

**CASB helps with:**  
| **Feature** | **Purpose** |
|--------------|-------------|
| **SSO (Single Sign-On)** | Lets users log in once for multiple apps securely. |
| **Access Control** | Manages who can access which data. |
| **Malware Scanning** | Detects infected or unauthorized files/devices. |
| **Activity Monitoring** | Tracks user and resource actions. |
| **Data Protection** | Reduces the risk of leaks or theft. |

### **Reflection**

While doing this, I started to understand how **virtualization** and **cloud computing** actually work together.  
Before, I just used apps online without thinking how they’re managed.  
Now I know that things like **hypervisors, CDNs, and CASBs** keep systems running fast and secure.  

This topic made me appreciate **Information Assurance and Security** more because it’s not just about protecting data —  
it’s about making sure everything behind the scenes is working safely and efficiently.
