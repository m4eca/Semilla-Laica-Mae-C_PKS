- Always **lock your computer or phone** when not in use.  
- Avoid plugging in **unknown USB drives or devices**.  
- Be careful with **emails or messages** that ask for personal information.

###  Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- **Definition:**  
  Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an **extra layer of security** when logging into an account.  
  Instead of just a password, it requires something else — like a code sent to your phone, fingerprint scan, or security key.  

- **Why it matters:**  
  Even if someone steals your password, they still can’t access your account without the second verification step.  

**Examples of MFA factors:**
1. Something you **know** – password or PIN.  
2. Something you **have** – phone, token, or security app.  
3. Something you **are** – fingerprint, facial recognition, or biometrics.

### Public Network Safety

- Avoid using **public Wi-Fi** for banking or logging into important accounts.  
- If you really need to use it, connect through a **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** for encryption.  
- Turn off **file sharing** and **Bluetooth** when not needed.  
- Always **log out** after using accounts on shared or public devices.  
- Be cautious when connecting to Wi-Fi networks with generic names like “Free_WiFi” or “Public_Net.”

### Backups

Keeping backups ensures that your data can be recovered if your system crashes, gets infected, or files are accidentally deleted.

**3-2-1 Rule:**  
- **3:** Have at least three up-to-date copies of your data.  
- **2:** Store them on two different types of storage (like an external drive and your PC).  
- **1:** Keep one copy in another location, such as cloud storage.  
Regular backups help protect against **data loss, ransomware**, and **hardware failure**.

## Reflection
I learned that I shouldn’t easily trust or connect to free Wi-Fi in malls or public places because it can actually steal personal information. I used to do this a lot, especially when I didn’t have mobile data, but now I’m more aware of the risks. From now on, I’ll be more careful and choose safer ways to protect my privacy and personal data whenever I go online. This topic really made me think about how small habits, like connecting to Wi-Fi can have a big impact on security.
