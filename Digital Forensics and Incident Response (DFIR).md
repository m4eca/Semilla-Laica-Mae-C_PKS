# Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)

## What is DFIR?

**Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)** focuses on investigating, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity incidents.  
It’s all about finding out **what happened, how it happened, and how to prevent it from happening again**.

- **Digital Forensics** – Deals with collecting and examining digital evidence from computers, servers, or networks.  
- **Incident Response** – Focuses on detecting, controlling, and recovering from security breaches or attacks.

Both work together to keep systems secure and to ensure that evidence is handled properly when something goes wrong.

## Digital Forensics

- The goal is to **find digital evidence** that can explain how a cyberattack or crime occurred.  
- Investigators follow strict procedures so evidence isn’t damaged or tampered with.

### Key Sources of Evidence

- **File System:**  
  Stores important traces like deleted files, metadata, and timestamps that can reveal user actions.  

- **System Memory (RAM):**  
  Contains running processes, passwords in memory, and temporary data that may disappear when the system is turned off.  

- **System Logs:**  
  Records of user logins, software installations, and system activities that help trace events leading up to an incident.  

- **Network Logs:**  
  Capture data traffic between systems — useful for spotting suspicious connections, IP addresses, or unusual behavior.

  ## Incident Response

Incident Response (IR) is about **reacting fast and correctly** when a security incident happens.

**Phases of Incident Response:**
1. **Preparation** – Set up tools, plans, and teams before any attack happens.  
2. **Identification** – Detect if an incident is really occurring.  
3. **Containment** – Stop the attack from spreading or causing more damage.  
4. **Eradication** – Remove the threat completely from the system.  
5. **Recovery** – Restore systems and make sure they’re clean and working again.  
6. **Lessons Learned** – Review what happened and improve defenses for next time.

## Importance of DFIR

- Helps **minimize damage** after an attack.  
- Provides **proof and evidence** for investigations or legal actions.  
- Improves the organization’s **security posture** by learning from past incidents.  
- Builds accountability and trust by showing how incidents are handled properly.

## Reflection

From this topic, I learned how **Digital Forensics and Incident Response** go hand in hand in keeping systems secure.  
It’s not just about stopping attacks — it’s about finding out exactly what happened and making sure it doesn’t happen again.  
DFIR also shows how important proper evidence handling and documentation are, especially in real-world investigations.  
For me as an IT student, this topic highlights how technical and analytical thinking come together in cybersecurity work.
