# Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)

## What is DFIR?

**Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)** focuses on investigating, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity incidents.  
It’s all about finding out **what happened, how it happened, and how to prevent it from happening again**.

- **Digital Forensics** – Deals with collecting and examining digital evidence from computers, servers, or networks.  
- **Incident Response** – Focuses on detecting, controlling, and recovering from security breaches or attacks.

Both work together to keep systems secure and to ensure that evidence is handled properly when something goes wrong.

## Digital Forensics

- The goal is to **find digital evidence** that can explain how a cyberattack or crime occurred.  
- Investigators follow strict procedures so evidence isn’t damaged or tampered with.

### Key Sources of Evidence

- **File System:**  
  Stores important traces like deleted files, metadata, and timestamps that can reveal user actions.  

- **System Memory (RAM):**  
  Contains running processes, passwords in memory, and temporary data that may disappear when the system is turned off.  

- **System Logs:**  
  Records of user logins, software installations, and system activities that help trace events leading up to an incident.  

- **Network Logs:**  
  Capture data traffic between systems — useful for spotting suspicious connections, IP addresses, or unusual behavior.

## Incident Response

Incident Response (IR) is about **reacting fast and correctly** when a security incident happens.

## Incident Response Lifecycle (Four Phases)

**Incident Response (IR)** is a structured approach to handle and manage security incidents efficiently.  
The goal is to **minimize damage** and **recover operations** as quickly as possible.

1. **Preparation:**  
   - Setting up response plans, tools, and trained teams before incidents happen.  
   - Includes creating backups, updating software, and defining communication procedures.  

2. **Detection and Analysis:**  
   - Identifying unusual behavior or alerts that indicate a possible attack.  
   - Analyzing logs, reports, and alerts to confirm if it’s a real incident.  

3. **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery:**  
   - **Containment:** Isolate the affected systems to stop the spread of the attack.  
   - **Eradication:** Remove malicious files or accounts from the system.  
   - **Recovery:** Restore systems and monitor them to make sure they’re safe.  

4. **Post-Incident Activity:**  
   - Reviewing what happened, what went right, and what needs improvement.  
   - Updating policies, training, and security measures based on lessons learned.

  ## Importance of DFIR

- Helps **minimize damage** after an attack.  
- Provides **proof and evidence** for investigations or legal actions.  
- Improves the organization’s **security posture** by learning from past incidents.  
- Builds accountability and trust by showing how incidents are handled properly.

## Reflection

What I learned from this topic is how important digital evidence is when dealing with cybersecurity incidents. Even small traces from system logs or memory can help figure out how an attack happened. As an IT student, this topic reminded me that solving security issues isn’t just about fixing things fast, it’s about being accurate, careful, and learning from every incident.
